JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation

_JSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent syntax for defining data interchange formats_. 
It was derived from the [ECMAScript programming language](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-404.pdf), but is programming language independent. 
JSON defines a small set of structuring rules for the portable representation of structured data.

JSON text is a sequence of tokens formed from Unicode code points that conforms to the JSON value grammar.

JSON value can be an object, array, number, string, true, false, or null.

Examples of json:

```
{"age": 45}
{"names": ["Harry", "Mike", "Alison"]}
{"some_value": null}
```
